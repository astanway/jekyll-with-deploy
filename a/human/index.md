I am New York based data engineer, currently working as a research engineer for <a href="http://detectica.com">Detectica</a>.

My interests include machine learning, anomaly and fraud detection, timeseries analysis, and distributed systems.

Some of my past clients and employers include McKinsey, Graphistry, Planet Labs, and Etsy.

I was a founder of <a href="http://twitter.com/hackerleague">Hacker League</a>, the widely used hackathon management platform, which my co-founders and I <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/12/03/intel-embraces-hackathons-with-acquisition/">sold</a> to Intel's Mashery.
