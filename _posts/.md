title: To All My Former Campers (and Other Undergraduates)
excerpt: Many of you have reached out to me in the past few weeks asking about advice about how to break into the technology world. That's awesome! I've been giving roughly the same advice over and over again, so like a good and lazy programmer, I'm going to write it all down once so I don't have to do again.

Many of you have reached out to me in the past few weeks asking about advice about how to break into the technology world. That's awesome! I've been giving roughly the same advice over and over again, so like a good and lazy programmer, I'm going to write it all down once so I don't have to do again.

So, if you're just starting or about to enter college and are interested in becoming an awesome engineer by the time you graduate, this is my standard advice, 2014 version. This post is aimed at anyone who is interested in immediately making six figures upon graduation, working on cool problems and setting themselves up for a long, fruitful career of doing awesome things with computers:

**1. Drop whatever you are studying and switch to computer science.**

You are an engineer now. This is the first step, and your CS degree will teach you all the things you didn't know you didn't know. Supplement your CS degree with a minor that is awesome, fun, and useless, like philosophy, history, or English literature. Except that these aren't useless at all, because they will teach you how to write, which is imperative to being a good programmer.

*"What? What does writing have to do with programming?"*

Everything. Programming is about thinking hard, thinking critically, revising, and expressing ideas elegantly and concisely. Just like writing.

**2. Start building things outside of class, because class is useless**

*"What!? Didn't you just tell me that CS will teach me everything I need to know?"*

No. CS will teach you lots of things that will come handy over the course of many years, but it won't teach you much that will come in handy right now. It'll teach you to become a scientist, not an engineer. Right now, you need to be come an engineer. Engineers build things. So think of a thing that you want and then figure out how to build it. Start with a small website. Write a scraper. When I was in school, I was tired of getting shut out of classes, so I built [The Schedule Sniper](http://abe.is/a/sniper) - it solved a problem I had and it was lots of fun to build.

Building things serves many functions: it teaches you to think holistically about a problem, it teaches you how to ship software, and it gives you something to talk about in interviews. People want to hire people that build things. One excellent way to get things built is to go to hackathons. [Major League Hacking](http://mlh.io) is a great resource for finding hackathons near you. As an undergrad, I went to dozens of hackathons and I credit them for my early development.

**3. Take some statistics and machine learning classes**

If you've done the first two or have made significant progress, the next step is to up your math game. Don't be scared of this kind of math: I assure you, it's incredibly awesome and fun. Want to be able to detect if there is a bird in an image? Want to be able to automatically detect if a phone call is fraudulent or not? Want to be able to predict how many users will visit your website next Christmas? Some of the coolest problems in computer-land today involve lots of statistics and machine learning and getting exposure to that while you're an undergrad is an incredible thing you can do for yourself.

**4. Have a productive summer and apply to hackNY**

Internships are going to be the best ways you learn. Make sure you're working under an engineer, wherever you end up. It doesn't have to be hackNY either - there are many internship programs to strive for. If you don't find one you like / can get in to, find a company you like, email their CTO, show them a cool project you made, and ask to be an intern. They will say yes, maybe. Everyone is hiring these days.

So, in recap:

**1. CS degree**

**2. Build things outside of class and go to hackathons**

**3. Learn statistics and machine learning**

**4. Get an engineering internship**
